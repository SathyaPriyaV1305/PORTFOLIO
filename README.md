This is my personal portfolio website.
It introduces me — Sathya Priya V, a Computer Science and Engineering student.
The site starts with a clean header and easy navigation menu.
In the About section, I’ve shared a little about my background and goals.
The Qualification section shows my education details in a simple table.
I’ve added some of my certificates to highlight what I’ve learned outside the classroom.
Each certificate has an image and a short title.
You’ll also find my contact details if you’d like to reach out.
The design is clean and user-friendly with a focus on clarity.
This website is a small step toward showcasing who I am and what I do.
